# AutoIrrigate

This system aims at automating the irrigation process in agricultural fields in order to reduce manual labor and prevent the wastage of water by implementing drip irrigation. The prototype was built using a microcontroller, appropriate sensors and a servo motor.<br/><br/>

## Description
1) The model is a small scale implementation of a system which can check the moisture content of the soil and irrigate it accordingly.
2) On checking the quantity of water present in the tank using an ultrasonic sensor, a warning is given when the water goes below a particular level.
3) Based on the moisture requirements of different types of soil/crops as indicated by the moisture sensor the amount of water can be regulated using a valve made using a servo motor.

## Requirements 
1) Arduino Microcontroller
2) Servo motor: to control the flow of water from the tank through rotation 
3) Ultrasonic sensor: to measure the level of water in the tank
4) Moisture sensor: to measure the moisture content in the soil
5) Jumper Wires
6) Breadboard


## Applications
Agriculture plays a vital role in the Indian economy. This automated irrigation system would be helpful in the agricultural industry by reducing the manual labour required and by ensuring efficient usage of water in the fields, thereby ultimately increasing the produce quality.
